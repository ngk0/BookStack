# Finding Information

BookStack makes it easy to find what you need. This page covers all the ways to navigate and search the system.

## Using Search

The search bar at the top of every page is the fastest way to find content.

### Search Tips

1. **Use specific terms** - "VFD startup procedure" works better than "drives"
2. **Try different words** - If "motor control" doesn't work, try "VFD" or "starter"
3. **Search for tags** - Type a tag like `status:approved` to find tagged content
4. **Use quotes** - Put "exact phrases" in quotes for precise matches

### What Search Covers

Search looks through:
- Page titles
- Page content
- Chapter and book names
- Tags
- Attachments (file names)
