# Introduction & Purpose

Welcome to the EIC Engineering Knowledge Base. This BookStack instance serves as our team's central repository for engineering standards, procedures, training materials, and institutional knowledge.

## What is BookStack?

BookStack is an open-source documentation platform organized in a familiar hierarchy:

- **Shelves** contain related books (like sections of a library)
- **Books** contain chapters and pages (like physical books)
- **Chapters** group related pages within a book
- **Pages** hold the actual content

This structure makes it easy to organize large amounts of technical information in a way that's intuitive to navigate.

## Why We Use It

Before BookStack, our engineering knowledge was scattered across:
- Shared drives with inconsistent folder structures
- Email threads that get lost
- Individual engineers' notes and documents
- Tribal knowledge that walked out the door when people left

BookStack solves these problems by providing:

1. **Single Source of Truth** - One place for all standards and procedures
2. **Version Control** - Full revision history on every page
3. **Search** - Find anything instantly across all content
4. **Access Control** - Role-based permissions for who can view and edit
5. **Always Available** - Web-based, accessible from anywhere

## The EIC Knowledge Vision

Our goal is to capture and preserve engineering knowledge so that:

- New team members can onboard quickly and effectively
- Best practices are documented and followed consistently
- Lessons learned are captured and shared across projects
- Standards are maintained and accessible to everyone
- Institutional knowledge survives personnel changes

## Who Maintains This System

**System Administration:**
- Technical infrastructure is managed by IT/Admin
- Contact: [Your admin contact here]

**Content Governance:**
- Standards Authority team approves official standards
- Lead Engineers oversee content in their areas
- All team members are encouraged to contribute

## Getting Help

If you need assistance:

1. **Can't find something?** Use the search bar at the top of every page
2. **Need access?** Contact your supervisor or admin
3. **Found an error?** Leave a comment on the page or contact the page owner
4. **Technical issues?** Contact IT support
