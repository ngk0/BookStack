## Where Does My Content Go?

Use this decision tree:

1. **Is it about how to use our internal systems or get started?** → Getting Started
2. **Is it an official standard or design requirement?** → EIC Standards Library
3. **Is it a step-by-step procedure?** → SOPs & Procedures
4. **Is it about career development or training?** → Training & Development
5. **Is it external reference material or a template?** → Reference Materials
6. **Is it lessons learned or project experience?** → Project Knowledge Base

**Still not sure?** Ask a Lead Engineer or the Standards Authority team.

## Creating New Books or Chapters

If content doesn't fit existing books:
- Talk to a Lead Engineer about the best location
- Consider if an existing book should be expanded
- New books require Standards Authority approval
