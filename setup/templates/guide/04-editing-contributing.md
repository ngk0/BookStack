# Editing & Contributing

Everyone on the team is encouraged to contribute to our knowledge base. This page explains how to create and edit content.

## Before You Start

Check your permissions:
- **Can you edit?** Try clicking "Edit" on a page. If you don't see it, you may not have permission.
- **What can you create?** See the Roles & Permissions page for details.
- **Is it the right place?** See Content Organization to find where your content belongs.

## Creating New Pages

### Where to Create

Think about where your page belongs:
1. **Inside a chapter** - Click the chapter, then "New Page"
2. **Directly in a book** - Click the book, then "New Page"

### Creating a Page

1. Navigate to the chapter or book
2. Click **New Page**
3. Give it a clear, descriptive title
4. Write your content
5. Add relevant tags
6. Click **Save Page**

### Page Templates

We have templates for common document types:
- SOP (Standard Operating Procedure)
- Technical Specification
- Competency Checklist
- QC Checklist

To use a template:
1. Create a new page
2. Click **Page Templates** in the editor sidebar
3. Select the appropriate template
4. Customize the content

## Uploading Attachments

### Supported Files

You can attach files like:
- PDFs
- Images (PNG, JPG, GIF)
- Office documents
- CAD files (as attachments, not rendered)

### How to Attach Files

1. Edit the page
2. Click the **Attachments** tab (right sidebar)
3. Drag and drop files or click to browse
4. Files appear as download links on the page

### Embedding Images

To show an image inline (not just as a download):
1. Upload the image as an attachment
2. Copy the image link
3. Use the image button in the editor to insert it

## Linking Between Pages

### Creating Internal Links

1. Highlight the text you want to link
2. Click the link button
3. Search for the page you want to link to
4. Select it from results

### Link Best Practices

- Link to related content to help readers navigate
- Use descriptive link text ("see the VFD Startup Procedure" not "click here")
- Check links when editing - they may break if pages move

## Revision History

Every edit is saved in the page's revision history.

### Viewing History

1. Open the page
2. Click **Revisions** in the menu
3. See all changes with timestamps and authors

### Comparing Versions

Click two versions to see what changed between them - added text shown in green, removed in red.

### Reverting Changes

If something went wrong:
1. Find the good version in revision history
2. Click that revision
3. Click **Restore This Revision**

## Best Practices for Contributing

1. **Write clear titles** - Be specific: "PLC Tagging Standard" not "Tags"
2. **Use headings** - Break content into scannable sections
3. **Add tags** - Tag with `status:draft` until content is reviewed
4. **Credit sources** - Link to vendor docs or other references
5. **Keep it current** - Update pages when procedures change
6. **Review before saving** - Preview your changes

## Getting Your Content Reviewed

New content should go through review:

1. Tag your page with `status:draft`
2. Notify a reviewer (Lead Engineer or Standards Authority)
3. They will review and either:
   - Suggest changes
   - Approve and update tag to `status:approved`

See the Tag Workflow page for the complete approval process.
